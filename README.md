# Haven

Haven is a super simple plugin that allows you to deny most hostile mob spawn in an area defined by: Haven/NoSpawn/src/main/resources/repellers.list
Format: x,y,z,radius

Add new entries to the list, reload the server plugins.

TO DO:
Dynamically add new coordinates, commands.
Add "allowed" zones within denied zones, to allow smaller areas such as mob spawners within a larger denied zone.

Based on Mob Repellent 2.0, a discountinued 1.11 plugin that finally broke (for me) somewhere in 1.18:
