# Haven

Inspired Mob Repellent 2.0, a discountinued 1.11 plugin that finally broke (for me) somewhere in 1.18:

Haven is a super simple plugin that allows you to deny most hostile mob spawn in an area. The following commands can be used:

/haven create x y z radius

/haven delete x y z radius

/haven list


# Disclaimer!
This is a super simple plugin that works primarily for my own limited purposes. It is likely inefficient, as it's my first real exposure to Minecraft plugin development and one of my first Java programs. 

# TO DO:
Add "allowed" zones within denied zones, to allow smaller areas such as mob spawners within a larger denied zone.
